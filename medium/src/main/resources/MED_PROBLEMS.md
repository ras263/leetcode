###2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

    Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
    Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
    Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
    
Solution:
    
    Create inner method which allows me to
     pass through integer (1 or 0) to adding it to the next
      list node computed value.
    To be continued.

###3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

    Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", 
    which the length is 3.
    
    Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
    
    Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
